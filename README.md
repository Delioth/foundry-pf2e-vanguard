# Foundry PF2e Vanguard
Welcome to the Foundry Module for the Pathfinder 2nd Edition Vanguard class, a Pathfinder Infinite title by yours truly.

To install this module, you must first have a valid FoundryVTT installation. Go to the Add-On Modules browser, click the button to install a module, put `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Delioth/foundry-pf2e-vanguard/main/module.json` in the manifest JSON textbox, and click install. Then, once you load up a PF2e world, you can enable the PF2e-vanguard module to get all the content in my document imported directly into Foundry, with as much automation as I could reasonably manage!

If you stumbled into this project on your own, and are familiar with Pathfinder 2e but haven't purchased the Vanguard class, I'd encourage you to go check it out at (link pending - not yet released) - the content is licensed under the Open Gaming License so you're absolutely free to use all the rules content, but it's also super encouraging to see people interested in the products!
