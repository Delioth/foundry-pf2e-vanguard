These proficiencies are noted in the sidebar on page 3.</p>\n<h2>Shield Block</h2>\n<p>You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block}&nbsp;general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>\n<h2>Valorous Path</h2>\n<p>All vanguards follow a path that pushes them forward and centralizes their great strength. All vanguards choose a Valor at 1st level, and gain the bold path ability of their selected valor.</p>\n<h2>Heavy Tank</h2>\n<p>A master of perfect timing and precise positioning in a fight, you can protect yourself from most foes, and can swiftly punish openings the enemy leaves for you. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-actions.GOvUseckRBjjojQR]{Perfect Guard} and @Compendium[pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-actions.KfwMtHv9ai3xCtBi]{Punishment} actions.</p>\n<h2>Vanguard Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a vanguard class feat. vanguard class feats are described beginning shortly.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">2ND</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">3RD</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.</p>\n<h2>Knight's Arsenal<span style=\"float: right;\">3RD</span></h2>\n<p>A vanguard is well trained and lives with their arsenal. Squares within the vanguard's reach are considered difficult terrain to your foes. While wearing any armor, you can rest normally, rather than receiving poor rest that leaves you fatigued. You gain the armor specialization effects of heavy armor.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">3RD</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you&rsquo;re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you&rsquo;re already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you&rsquo;re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you&rsquo;re already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float: right;\">5TH</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry&rsquo;s entry in Chapter 2.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts <span style=\"float: right;\">5TH</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it&rsquo;s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts below 18.</p>\n<h2>Prowess <span style=\"float: right;\">5TH</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill and fervor make your weapons deadly. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut <span style=\"float: right;\">7TH</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float: right;\">7TH</span></h2>\n<p>You hit with precise skill or pure the weight of your armor. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you have expert proficiency. This damage increases to 3 if you&rsquo;re a master, and 4 if you&rsquo;re legendary.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes <span style=\"float: right;\">9TH</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Steel Path <span style=\"float: right;\">9TH</span></h2>\n<p>You've trained in your valor. You gain the Steel Path ability of your valor. Your proficiency rank for your class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness <span style=\"float: right;\">11TH</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Resolve <span style=\"float: right;\">11TH</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Heavy Master <span style=\"float: right;\">13TH</span></h2>\n<p>Your training with your armor makes you a true bastion in the field. Your proficiency rank in heavy armor increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery <span style=\"float: right;\">13TH</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float: right;\">15TH</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you&rsquo;re an expert, 6 if you&rsquo;re a master, and 8 if you&rsquo;re legendary.</p>\n<h2>Knight's Bulwark <span style=\"float: right;\">15TH</span></h2>\n<p>You may roll Fortitude instead of Reflex against damaging effects; however, if you replace a basic save in this way, you still take half damage on a critical success. When foes attempt to move you or knock you prone without a check (such as the Push monster ability), they must succeed at an Athletics check against your Fortitude DC to do so, rather than automatically succeeding.</p>\n<h2>Adamantine Path <span style=\"float: right;\">17TH</span></h2>\n<p>You strive for and attain perfection, a paragon of your valorous path. You gain the Adamantine Path ability of your valor. Your proficiency rank for your class DC increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Heavy Legend <span style=\"float: right;\">17TH</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with heavy armor surpasses what others consider impossible. Your proficiency rank for heavy armor increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Unstoppable <span style=\"float: right;\">19TH</span></h2>\n<p>You're a true juggernaut on the field. Decrease the DC of perfect guard by 1 (usually to DC 10).</p>"},"source":{"value":"Volume of the Vanguard"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[{"adjustName":false,"choices":[{"label":"PF2E.SkillAth","value":"ath"},{"label":"PF2E.SkillItm","value":"itm"}],"flag":"skillChoice","key":"ChoiceSet","prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Prompt.Skill"},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"data.skills.{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.skillChoice}.rank","value":1}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.738,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-04-19T17:15:15.543-05:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.8.4.11118"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["con","str"]},"items":{"7ydqy":{"pack":"pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-features","id":"Ji8KTrD2GXlw0Cc8","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-sword-blue.webp","name":"Valorous Path","level":1},"t0wg8":{"pack":"pf2e.classfeatures","id":"eZNCckLzbH3GyncH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/shield-block.webp","name":"Shield Block","level":1},"jp4gp":{"pack":"pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-features","id":"HnLfg16Nr9q8Ww5S","img":"icons/equipment/chest/breastplate-collared-steel.webp","name":"Heavy Tank","level":1},"6qbey":{"pack":"pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-features","id":"iKDtUaqGsAfBakqz","img":"icons/equipment/hand/gauntlet-armored-leather-steel-blue.webp","name":"Knight's Arsenal","level":3},"20dxq":{"pack":"pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-features","id":"iyEv2nzwoFm6wcLT","img":"icons/weapons/swords/sword-guard-red.webp","name":"Prowess","level":5},"duibc":{"pack":"pf2e.classfeatures","id":"OMZs5y16jZRW9KQK","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/juggerenaut.webp","name":"Juggernaut","level":7},"i08rj":{"pack":"pf2e.classfeatures","id":"9EqIasqfI8YIM3Pt","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Weapon Specialization","level":7},"r4mwl":{"pack":"pf2e.classfeatures","id":"TUOeATt52P43r5W0","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/lightning-reflexes.webp","name":"Lightning Reflexes","level":9},"ogli8":{"pack":"pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-features","id":"HsUdtKCLvsoLKyrW","img":"icons/commodities/metal/ingot-iron.webp","name":"Bold Path","level":1},"mmnq2":{"pack":"pf2e.classfeatures","id":"D8CSi8c9XiRpVc5M","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/alertness.webp","name":"Alertness","level":11},"55ea1":{"pack":"pf2e.classfeatures","id":"JQAujUXjczVnYDEI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/resolve.webp","name":"Resolve","level":11},"960aj":{"pack":"pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-features","id":"wvfH9PBYedCoGVw0","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/armor-mastery.webp","name":"Heavy Master","level":13},"djpba":{"pack":"pf2e.classfeatures","id":"i6563IU7x4L9oRgC","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-mastery.webp","name":"Weapon Mastery","level":13},"72hjl":{"pack":"pf2e.classfeatures","id":"Z7HX6TeFsaup7Dx9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Greater Weapon Specialization","level":15},"icy1o":{"pack":"pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-features","id":"XAAHAh6tM8NnQfvn","img":"icons/equipment/shoulder/pauldron-segmented-steel-white.webp","name":"Knight's Bulwark","level":15},"y776x":{"pack":"pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-features","id":"kLffl3YsQ5y5IEPk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/legendary-armor.webp","name":"Heavy Legend","level":17},"wm4dk":{"pack":"pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-features","id":"5C5CmassLychA2UB","img":"icons/commodities/metal/ingot-teal.webp","name":"Adamantine Path","level":17},"9pbi2":{"pack":"pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-features","id":"1HdAUazV5r7C7r9d","img":"icons/creatures/abilities/bear-roar-bite-brown-green.webp","name":"Unstoppable","level":19},"y79xy":{"pack":"pf2e-vanguard.vanguard-features","id":"txNLqh4EytLrwcWt","img":"icons/commodities/metal/ingot-plain-steel.webp","name":"Steel Path","level":9}},"hp":12,"trainedSkills":{"value":[],"additional":3,"custom":""},"perception":1,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":1,"will":2},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":2},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]},"abilityBoostLevels":{"value":[5,10,15,20]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"gKRAixZcnc2H4VRx":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.BR8CiK0xRdJGygCz"}},"_id":"DFdUyPMwC5rZmerE"}
